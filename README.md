# Task 3: Basic Weather App

Welcome to the Basic Weather App repository! This project is part of my internship with **Oasis Infobyte**. The app provides real-time weather updates for any city using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Updates**: Fetches and displays current weather conditions for any city.
- **Weather Icons**: Shows weather conditions with corresponding icons.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input the city name and view weather details.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Fetches weather data from the API and updates the UI dynamically.

## API Integration

The app integrates with the WeatherAPI to fetch weather data. Please ensure you have a valid API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to use this app.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for functionality.
